# Movie Sorter  
### This project sorts the movies that I own by genre and list movie parameter such as ratings, format, and personalized comments as well as including an image of each movie. It was completed as a project for my Intro to Javascript class with Galvanise. 
Languages used for this project include:
* HTML
* CSS
* javaScript
* jQuery

### Query Selectors
Query selectors were used to account for different screen sizes.
